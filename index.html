    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Our solar system includes the Sun, eight planets, 
        five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, 
        and thousands of asteroids and comets. Our solar system 
        is located in the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy with
        two major arms, and two minor arms. Our Sun is in a small, 
        partial arm of the Milky Way called the Orion Arm, or Orion Spur, 
        between the Sagittarius and Perseus arms.
         Our solar system orbits the center of the galaxy at about 515,000 mph (828,000 kph). 
         It takes about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</p>

    <h2>Size and Distance</h2>
    <p>Our solar system extends much farther than the planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes
         the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than 
         the most popular Kuiper Belt Object ‚Äì dwarf planet Pluto.

        Beyond the fringes of the Kuiper Belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds our solar
         system. It has never been directly observed, but its existence is predicted based on mathematical models
         and observations of comets that likely originate there.</p>

    <h2>Moons</h2>
    <p>
        Our solar system has hundreds of moons orbiting planets, dwarf planets, and asteroids.

        Of the eight planets, Mercury and Venus are the only ones with no moons, although Venus does have a quasi-
        satellite 
        that has officially been named Zoozve. 
        
        The giant planets Jupiter and Saturn lead our solar system‚Äôs moon counts. In some ways, the swarms of moons 
        around these worlds resemble mini versions of our solar system.
        
        Pluto, smaller than our own moon, has five moons in its orbit, including Charon, a moon so large it makes 
        Pluto wobble.
